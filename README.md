# go-multisolver

An implementation of the algorithm for simultaneously solving of multiple global optimizations problems. This method allows to achive uniform convergence to set of global optimums for all problems treated simultaneously.

Description of the method and numerical results can be found in the following paper: Konstantin Barkalov, Roman [Strongin, Solving a set of global optimization problems by the parallel technique with uniform convergence][paper], Journal of Global Optimization, 1573-2916, 2017
